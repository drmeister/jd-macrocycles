# Macrocycles that JD is synthesizing or plans to synthesize

## Requirements

   Docker - http://docker.com


## Directories

synthesized - Compounds that JD has synthesized

designs - Compounds that JD can synthesize

	for designs, the filename will give some indication as to the structure of the molecule
	macrocycles: xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx, for instance tri-ep-tri-ala means a 6 mer macrocycle 
	with three enhanced proline and three L-alanine residues, whereas di-epdi-tet-gly would 
	mean a 6 mer macrocycle with two enhanced proline dimers and 4 glycine residues
