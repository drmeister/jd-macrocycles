# Macrocycles that JD is synthesizing or plans to synthesize

## Requirements

   Docker - http://docker.com


## Directories

synthesized - Compounds that JD has synthesized

	EAA-Trials-Spreadsheet - All data pertaining to enhanced proline couplings
	EAA-Trials-chemdraw - Shows the coupling that was performed for the data in the spreadsheet
	EAA-Scheme-Stocks - Shows the synthesis of the monomers and my current amino acid stock on hand

designs - Compounds that JD can synthesize

	for designs, the filename will give some indication as to the structure of the molecule
	macrocycles: xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx, for instance tri-ep-tri-ala means a 6 mer macrocycle 
	with three enhanced proline and three L-alanine residues, whereas di-epdi-tet-gly would 
	mean a 6 mer macrocycle with two enhanced proline dimers and 4 glycine residues

paper - documents for the first paper

	Direct document from my thesis -chapter 3- without any edits. most likely needs major overhaul
	to be a viable manuscript draft. Does not contain any new data pertaining to the first two tables
	of the trials spreadsheet, nor does it have any of the peptoid macrocycle data yet. 

lib - Library files
